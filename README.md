# SmileSchool Landing Page

This is a simple landing page project built as part of the **ALX Front-End program**. It demonstrates core and advanced HTML and CSS concepts, including semantic HTML structure, responsive design layout, and styling techniques.

##  Project Overview

The project replicates a "SmileSchool" landing page design based on a Figma prototype. While I couldn't fully match every detail from the design due to current limitations, I did my best to implement the major sections, layout, and styling using vanilla HTML and CSS.

### Features


- Custom navigation bar
- Hero section with call-to-action
- “Learn from the Pros” showcase
- Testimonials, membership features, tutorials
- Footer with social media icons

##  Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML file with semantic structure
- `styles.css` – External CSS for all styling
- Images – Placeholder images used; to be replaced with final assets

##  Notes

This is a work-in-progress and will continue to be improved over time to fully match the original Figma design. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
